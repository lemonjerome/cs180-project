"To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.",2
"(1) The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and international plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan performance. For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10- year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.",0
"Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions. Despite that much of the focus is on bitumen mining operations and not in-situ production, public concerns about oil sands generally and GHG emissions and water and land use practices in oil sands developments specifically may, directly or indirectly, impair the profitability of our current oil sands projects, and the viability of future oil sands projects, by creating significant regulatory uncertainty leading to uncertainty in economic modeling of current and future projects and delays relating to the sanctioning of future projects.",2
"During the first week of May 2016, extreme wildfires in northeastern Alberta resulted in the shutdown of a number of oil sands production facilities and the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from the city of Fort McMurray, which serves as a commercial and regional logistics centre for the oil sands region and a home to a significant portion of the oil sands workforce.",2
"Concerns regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards than the voluntary commitments that we have made or require such changes on a more accelerated timeframe. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, there are discussions regarding potential defunding of climate-related international agreements and/or initiatives that could affect our competitiveness in certain markets. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of our products and our results of operations.",2

"─ Risk and opportunity identification: adidas continuously monitors the macroeconomic environment and developments in the sporting goods industry as well as internal processes to identify risks and opportunities as early as possible. On a semi-annual basis, the Risk Management department conducts a survey with all members of the Core Leadership Group (CLG), Extended Leadership Group (ELG) and Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) to ensure an effective bottom-up identification of risks and opportunities. Risk Management has also defined 25 categories to help identify risks and opportunities in a systematic way. In addition, adidas uses various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups and product styles which show most potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes. Furthermore, as part of our identification process, we monitor physical risks related to climate change as well as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our risk and opportunity identification process is however not only limited to external risk factors or opportunities, it also includes an internal perspective that considers company culture, processes, projects, human resources and compliance aspects.",3
"Another key factor are the macrotrends observed in the sector: sustainable mobility (the search for travel solutions with lower environmental impact), climate change (in the form of mitigation and contrast, and also adaptation) and the circular economy, i.e. the attention paid to end of life of assets and the possible reuse of some elements.",2

"What would be the critical ESG issues in the future, and what does LG Chem need to prepare? The latest trend is related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure TCFD. In other words, the trend is evaluating the financial values of non-financial information. The relevant companies would need to follow this trend and disclose related information faithfully. As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading. The recent safety accident was probably inevitable due to the business characteristics, but LG Chem should remediate the situation swiftly and systematically and come up with a solid measure to prevent recurrence. In this process, LG Chem needs to hear and reflect the opinions of the stakeholders through the active engagement of experts.",2
"In the past six years, our supervisory work and thematic reviews of CFD firms have found increasing instances of poor conduct and risks of consumer detriment across the sector. Our analysis of a representative sample of CFD client accounts found that these products were increasingly being sold to retail clients and that 82% of clients lost money on these products. As a result, in 2016 we published a consultation paper proposing a package of policy measures to address these risks.",0

"Ecological factors and environmental regulations for access to raw material deposits also create a degree of uncertainty. In some regions of the world, for example in West Africa south of the Sahara, raw materials for cement production are so scarce that cement or clinker needs to be imported by sea. Rising transportation costs and capacity constraints in the port facilities can lead to an increase in product costs. Overall, we rate this as a low risk.",2
"In light of such events there has been a rise in climate-change activism epitomised by Greta Thunberg. We have also witnessed a plethora of pledges from both companies and politicians to tackle climate change, but real, decisive action supporting the pledges to reduce emissions has yet to surface. The uncomfortable truth is that our entire economy is based on fossil fuels, and therefore moving to a low-carbon future will affect all sectors. Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty.",2
"In 2017, I commissioned Newton’s first TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report to ensure that we were holding ourselves to the same standards as our investee companies, and specifically to explain how we were considering, and preparing for, the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Following the first report, I am delighted to introduce our second TCFD report which combines updates from 2018 and 2019, during which period we have made a number of positive changes. Highlights include establishing board-level oversight for Newton’s actions on climate-related risks, entering into new data relationships with carbon experts, undertaking significant internal education, and establishing a climate change-focused investment group to undertake climate scenario analysis.",4
"Whilst the transition scenarios saw material impacts on the investment portfolio, the most notable impacts on both investments and insurance liabilities arose from the physical effects of no transition, that is no additional actions beyond those already announced. Based on the PRA specifications, Scenario C, in which physical risk dominates, resulted in the most significant impact on the Group but did not breach risk appetite despite not allowing for reinsurance. This demonstrates the resilience of the Group’s strategy to such a scenario. Furthermore, the projected time frame (2100) for this scenario is likely to allow the business to adapt. The share of transition versus physical risks by scenario is shown below.",2
