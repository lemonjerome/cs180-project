{"text":"Climate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. The risks for insurers can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from climate trends (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher than expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to the mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks and has limited exposure to P&C risk, including catastrophic risk. Beyond insured losses from physical climate damages, climate change can increase uninsured damages and losses and may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and across the financial system. The second category of risks is associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks can affect the value of assets and impact the investments portfolios of insurers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that Aegon itself is unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. The transition risks are determined by largely uncertain factors such as policy and regulatory changes, political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks.

As a member of the Energy Savers Circle of Hydro-Quebec (a public utility that manages the transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec), the Bank has set up an innovative web-based interface to remotely manage energy use at over 100 of its branches. This system allows the Bank to oversee its facilities and make sure they meet energy efficiency goals, year after year. The Bank also implements the criteria for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification in its buildings and aims for LEED v4 Gold certification for its new head office to be completed in 2023. Among other things, this allows the Bank to reduce its Greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in activities. Our Greenhouse gas emissions for 2019 have been calculated at 9,732 tonnes of CO2-down 16% compared to 2017. The Bank has renewed its commitment to carbon neutrality by buying carbon credits to offset emissions that can't be eliminated.

The process is based on production of a synthetic gas from carbon-based material. The synthetic gas produced in this way is first purified so that it can subsequently be used to synthesise methanol or to produce pure hydrogen. Methanol produced using waste as a raw material could be considered as a Recycled Carbon Fuel, as provided for by the RED II European directive on renewable energy, and therefore assimilable to a biofuel. It can be used in petrols by transformation into MTBE, or mixed with experimental high alcohol content petrols together with bioethanol (A20 pet- rol). A new fuel, A20, based on a mix containing 15% methanol and 5% bioethanol has been developed with the FCA Group and subjected to a 13-month test in which five Fiat 500s of the Enjoy fleet travelled about 50,000 km, when rented out for a total of 9,000 times, without encountering any problems.

PME is convinced that the business operations of mining companies that focus solely on coal are not future-proof and these producers therefore represent a risk to PME's investment portfolio. Investments are also no longer made in producers of tar sand oil. Its production is seen as too harmful to the environment by PME, and the fund cannot identify with this. - Engagement.

The FTSE All World (ex controversial weapons) Climate Balanced Factor Index tilts away from Carbon Reserves and Carbon Emissions, whilst positively tilting towards Green Revenues. The tilts are set such that the inclusion of the climate-related tilts, introduces a relatively modest tracking error compared to the Balanced Factor index without climate tilts.

The non-financial performance criteria thus take the interests of key stakeholders into account and provide long-term incentives for the environmental goal of reducing specific carbon emissions. For the LTI, the possible range of the target achievement for the financial and non- financial targets is between 0% and 200%. For the non-financial target \u201cEnvironment\u201d, the targets set by IATA (International Air Transport Association) for fuel efficiency are used, i.e. the average amount of kerosene consumed to carry a passenger 100 kilometres. The aim is to reduce specific fuel consumption by 1.5% p.a. and so to improve specific CO2 emissions. The LTI for 2020 includes emissions from Lufthansa\u2019s own fleet as well as those from wet lease flights. To calculate performance, the improvement in specific CO2 emissions is measured annually over the four-year performance period.

Top-down reviews consist of one-on-one meetings with every member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) as well as select group Area Vice Presidents to get a regional and operations-focused viewpoint on risk. Bottom-up reviews are done in workshop format including all subject matter experts for a given headline risk as well as participants from regional operations.

The 'Pessimistic' scenario is where the world fails to address climate change, leading to global temperatures continuing to rise well above 2 degrees. This scenario assumes limited policy or regulatory support and looks at physical climate risks. The 'Optimistic' scenario is where the world rises to the challenge of tackling climate change and limits global warming to well below 2 degrees. This low-carbon transition scenario centres on the rapid changes that will be needed by 2030 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

{"text":"Capitalization of Inventory Costs We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management\u2019s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize.

{"text":"In this context, in the first half of the year the world economy has progressed at a slower pace (estimated 3.2%, compared to 3.5% in the second half of 2018), burdened by increased financial volatility and deteriorated confidence due to trade tensions. This comes in addition to a succession of idiosyncratic elements in key advanced economies (particularly in Europe). Nonetheless, in this less favourable environment, the growth figures of the main international economies are reasonably good. Thus, among the emerging economies, China showed favourable growth data (6.4% in the first quarter of 2019, the same figure as in the fourth quarter of 2018). This contrasts with various indicators, especially those related to exports, imports and manufacturing production, which imply that the climate of trade tensions has eroded the performance of external and industrial sectors. However, this burden has been offset by various stimulus measures implemented by the authorities in the fields of tax and monetary policies.","label":0}

{"text":" At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, the economic environment and prospects for the watchmaking industry were improved and Swatch Group was able to meet the high demands of the different markets. This was made possible by employees who not only remained active during the difficult months but also used the time available to acquire new skills and thus meet the challenges facing Swatch Group. It was important to maintain a good and open relationship with the staff, who acknowledged the efforts made by their em- ployers to maintain the positions as well as the general condi- tions required for each person\u2019s personal fulfillment.","label":0}
{"text":"The production capacity of integrated watch modules was increased during the year under review. These modules are used, for example, in the manufacture of Longines V.H.P. (Very High Precision) watches. At the same time, developments with miniature real-time clocks, as well as experience gained in this field, are helping Micro Crystal to significantly increase the accuracy of its integrated watch modules. The integration of quartz and an integrated circuit in the same package, along with temperature compensation and other environmental influences, will soon enable Swatch Group brands to produce even more accurate quartz watches. The improved miniature integrated watch modules have extremely low power consumption, which guar- antees long watch battery life. This progress in development was only possible thanks to the close cooperation between Micro Crystal and its sister companies EM Microelectronic and ETA Manufacture Horlog\u00e8re Suisse.","label":0}
{"text":"Wood, the building\u2019s leitmotif, is omnipresent, including a symbolic representation with five trees that create a distinctive atmosphere in various parts of the building: Bucida buceras are black olive trees originally native to tropical regions and which can grow to heights of up to two stories. These exotic visitors were chosen because their fine evergreen foliage copes well with room temperatures. The fourth and smallest floor by sur- face area stretches under the vaulted ceiling of the unusual wooden fa\u00e7ade. Here, visitors are closer to the \u201cskin of the build- ing\u201d than anywhere else.","label":0}
{"text":"Villeret M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art Binch\u014dtan Through its M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection, Blancpain innovates by combining the know-how of its craftsmen with ancestral decora- tive techniques rarely used in watchmaking. In 2018, the Maison presented its first dials in binch\u014dtan, a charcoal of remarkable quality because it is extremely dense, resulting from the slow combustion of ubamegashi wood in a clay furnace heated to around 1300 degrees Celsius. The sudden rise in temperature, followed by rapid cooling, reduces the bark of the tree to ashes and gives way to a smooth surface with a hardness comparable to that of steel. Blancpain has acquired this 17th century Japa- nese skill to create a series of unique dials.","label":0}
{"text":"Educating employees about the Kirin Group\u2019s approach to business In February 2019, the Group formulated the Kirin Group Vision 2027 as a long-term management vision with the goal of being a global leader in creating shared value (CSV). It also created a new mission statement to express its basic management concept of creating new value for stakeholders in and outside the Group.

{"text":"In Japan\u2019s soft drink market, sales of canned coffee have been on the decline in recent years. For Kirin Beverage, decreased sales of canned coffee products were having a relatively large impact on performance because these products are highly profitable. It was able to compensate for these results with growing sales of other products, but finding a way to halt the falling sales of FIRE became a serious issue. Compared with beer brands, devising medium- to long-term marketing strategies for soft drink brands is more difficult as the cycle of releasing new products and renewing existing brands is much faster. Kirin Beverage had been implementing a short-term cycle, as conventionally done by soft drink makers in Japan, but due to the impact of the downward trend in the market, its marketing campaigns were less and less successful. Therefore, in the autumn of 2019, Kirin Beverage adopted Kirin Brewery\u2019s marketing methods to renew FIRE in an effort to restart the brand\u2019s sales growth.","label":0}
